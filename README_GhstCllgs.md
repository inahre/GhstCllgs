# GhstCllgs â€“ Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion via DreamBooth

**GhstCllgs** is an artistic experiment in fine-tuning *Stable Diffusion* on a personal visual style using the **DreamBooth** technique. Built in Python and trained using a custom dataset of original collage-style works, the project explores how generative AI can learn from and contribute to an artistâ€™s creative process.


## **Overview**

- Trains a custom text-to-image diffusion model using only ~50 images.
- Applies the *DreamBooth* fine-tuning method on `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`.
- All training is performed on Google Colab with GPU acceleration.
- Final model outputs are analysed for style retention (texture, colour, composition).


## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ghstcllgs.git
```

2. Install dependencies

> A full Google Colab notebook is included in the repo (`dreambooth_project.ipynb`).


## **Usage**

### **Training**
To train your own model:
- Replace the dataset path in the notebook.
- Set your desired `instance_prompt` string.
- Run the notebook in Google Colab.

Checkpoints are saved to Google Drive or your Hugging Face Hub.

### **Inference**
After training, generate new images with your model using:
```python
pipe(prompt="your prompt in the style of ghstcllgs")
```


## **Sample Outputs**

Below are some outputs generated using the fine-tuned `ghstcllgs03` model:

### `"faceless"`
![output_1](assets/output_01.png)

### `"in the style of ghstcllgs"`
![output_2](assets/output_02.png)

### `"prisoner"`
![output_3](assets/output_03.png)

### `"the beach in sections"`
![output_4](assets/output_04.png)


## **Model Checkpoint**
